For this project I have fully met the specifications required in the assignment 1.08 PDF.
Upon the start of the program, the placer is given a choice between 3 starter pokemon, they can use the 1, 2, or 3 keys to select the pokemon respectively.
When the player walks through tall grass (the ':' terrain), there is a 10 % chance a wild pokemon will appear.
If an encounter occurs stats for that pokemon are displayed in the terminal.
I added getter methods in io.cpp for every stat needed and a method to display them in the terminal.
For the pokemon that the pc and npcs hold, I created a new header file called pokemon.h to hold the pokemon class.
All pokemon have stats that follow the formulas on the specification sheet along with the implemented randomness.
Exit the encounter interface with 'ESC' key.
