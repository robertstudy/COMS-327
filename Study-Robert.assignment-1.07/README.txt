For this project I have fully met the specifications required in the assignment 1.07 PDF.
I created 2 new files, fileparser.h and fileparser.cpp that are linked to each other and linked to poke327.cpp.
fileparser.h contains classes to help organize the data for each .csv file.
fileparser.cpp uses the classes and parses through each .csv file, printing out the parsed data line by line.
poke327.cpp was edited with a simples user interface that prompts the user what file that want to parse.
Each line of the selected file is parsed and displayed until it reaches the end of the file.
Once all data is parsed the program ends and it can be rerun to parse files.
