For this "Choose your own assignment", I chose to build a terminal based Connect 4 Game in C++.
It incorporates many of the topics we covered this semester like ncurses, algorithms, terminal styling, user inputs, and Makefiles.
The game is very straightforward to play.
Upon starting the game, one of the players will be randomly selected to go first.
Players can use the arrow keys to move the piece left or right at the top of the board.
Then, players can use the enter key to drop their respective piece.
The column that the current piece is above is highlighted to make it clear where the piece will be dropped.
Once a player makes 4 in a row, the game ends and will print the wining player.
If the board is full, but neither player has made 4 in a row, the game recognizes this as a draw.
Use 'q' to quit at any point during the game.
