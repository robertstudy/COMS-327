For this project I have fully met the specifications required in the assignment 1.05 PDF.
The map and the characters are colored using curses. 
The user can input specified keys (uppercase, lowercase, and numbers) to make the PC move, exit, or enter interfaces.
When the player and a trainer come are on the same tile, a temporary battle interface will appear, more functionality will be added later.
When a trainer is defeated the player swaps places with them, and the trainers move cost is set to INT_MAX so it cant path to the PC.
By hitting the 't' key, a list of trainers on the map, with their symbol and position relative to the PC will be displayed, this interface can be exited with the esc key.
The pokecenters and pokemarts have temporary interfaces which can be accessed using the right arrow key if the PC is on a pokecenter or pokemart tile.
Pokecenters, pokemarts, and battles can be exited using the left arrow key.
The user can exit the game by hitting the 'q' key.
