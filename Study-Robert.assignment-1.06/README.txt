For this project I have fully met the specifications required in the assignment 1.06 PDF.
I used my last assignment solution as a base and converted it to C++ code.
I also converted all of the structs from my last solution into classes for this assignment.
The program has functionality for all of the movement cases when the pc travels to a new map.
The program also has functionality for the fly command, just hit f, and then type x coordinate, space, y coordinate.
If you input coordinates outside of the bound of the world, an error interface appear.
Only bug is that sometimes the pc is hidden when entering a new map but moving it will make it reappear.
