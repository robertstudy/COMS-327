For this project I have fully met the specifications required in the assignment 1.09 PDF and example video.
I started by adding an inventory/bag to the pc to hold the three items (Pokeballs, Potions, and Revives).
Items cannot be used when you don't have any in your inventory, every item works as intended and you lose an item after you use it.
The fights work according to the specification, where stats for you and your opponent are listed.
Attacks can be made starting with key "1", then sequentially more keys if that pokemon has more attacks than just 1.
Potions and Revives can be used in battle using the "p" and "r" keys respectively.
There is also a pokemon switch tab that works by hitting the "s" key to enter the tab, then you can switch pokemon using the number keys or cancel using "c".
If you walk thought the tall grass and encounter a pokemon you can capture it, fight it, or run away with the potential of failure.
If you lose a battle, the game ends.
When you visit pokemarts and use ">", all of your items are restored back to a max of 5 each.
When you visit pokecenters and use ">", all of your current pokemon are restored to full health.
