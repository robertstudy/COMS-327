2/23/2024 1:10pm -> Added generateTrainers and spawnTrainers method calls into main.
2/23/2024 1:22pm -> Fixed core dump error becauseI forgot to allocate memory for the character.

2/23/2024 1:51pm -> Added trainer_turns field to the map structure to keep track of what trainers turn it is to move.
2/23/2024 1:57pm -> Added a pair_t next to the npc structure to hold the location of the next move for a trainer.

2/23/2024 2:20pm -> Fixed bug where trainers were added to wrong map, making it bigger than [21][81].
2/24/2024 5:45pm -> Fixed bug each new map was the same, seed wasn't changing.
2/24/2024 6:01pm -> Created a moveTrainers method which moves all the characters based in their assigned paths and movement specifications.
2/24/2024 8:20pm -> Added moveTrainer method call into main.
2/24/2024 8:41pm -> Fixed error where I tried to copy one array into another and the terminal printed out "PuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTYPuTTY".
2/24/2024 9:00pm -> Inserted the moved character into characterMap and heap in moveTrainer method to update the printed map.
2/24/2024 9:10pm -> Fixed bug where characters were not getting added to the heap.
2/24/2024 9:23pm -> Fixed bug where pacer would could change direction.
2/24/2024 9:31pm -> Added an infinite while loop with print_map, moveTrainers, and usleep() to continuously print updated maps with character movement.
