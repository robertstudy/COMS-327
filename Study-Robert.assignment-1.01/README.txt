For this project, I have fully met the specification that is required in the instructions.
The border has 4 exits(one on each side) and everything else on the border is a mountain given by the generateBorder method.
The randomly generated paths(#) will cross twice given by the generateRoads method.
Terrain will be randomly generated between with tallGrass(:), water(~), tree(^), or mountain(%) symbols.
Anything that is not any of the terrain listed above will be filled in with short grass(.).
All maps will have randomly generared pokemarts(MM) and pokecenters(CC) alongside a path using generateMart and generateCenter respectivly
The printMap method prints out the [21][80] map.
The main method runs all the previously mentioned methods in the stated order.
