2/1/2024 3:47pm -> implemented a world_maps_generate method.
2/1/2024 3:49pm -> added mart_prob, center_prob, and building_prob_funct variables to decrease the frequency of building spawn the further from origin.
2/1/2024 3:52pm -> added manhat_dist to calculate building_prob_funct.
2/1/2024 4:08pm -> added terrain generation to each map section.
2/1/2024 4:14pm -> wrote a function to place building based off of distance from origin.
2/1/2024 4:21pm -> move_dir, exit, fly_to_x, and fly_to_y variables in main.
2/1/2024 4:40pm -> added a UI with text and a scanf function to get directions from the user.
2/1/2024 6:45pm -> implemented switch case in main to switch between n, s, w, e, f, q.
2/1/2024 7:29pm -> implemented the n case.
2/1/2024 7:39pm -> fixed bug where program would exit after one move.
2/1/2024 7:45pm -> implemented the q case and a default case.
2/1/2024 8:26pm -> implemented the s case.
2/1/2024 8:51pm -> fixed bug where maps would remake themselves but only when going north, then back south.
2/1/2024 9:32pm -> fixed bug where paths would not line up between maps.
2/1/2024 9:32pm -> fixed bug where traveling to border would crash program.
2/2/2024 10:49am -> implemented the e and w cases.
2/2/2024 11:25am -> fixed bug where going south or west from origin would crash program
2/2/2024 11:43am -> implemented f or fly case.
2/2/2024 12:15pm -> fixed bug where fly operator would not change the x coordinate.
2/4/2024 8:05pm -> fixed bug where changing location via fly would give a location off the world.
2/4/2024 8:13pm -> fixed bug where fly command would remake a pervious maps.
2/6/2024 6:05pm -> fixed bug where program would crash when traveling e or w at the n or s borders

2/8/2024 5:00pm -> Added "dijkstra_path" and "build_paths" methods from solution drop to my solution from the last assignment.
2/8/2024 5:10pm -> Added terrain type "ter_character" and method "placeCharacter".
2/8/2024 5:16pm -> Edited the case switch in printMap so that a @ would be printed where ter_character was assigned.
2/8/2024 5:20pm -> Added call to placeCharacter method in new_map and world_maps_generate.
2/8/2024 5:37pm -> Fixed bug where character would not spawn.
2/8/2024 5:45pm -> Referenced "dijkstra_path" method to make "dijkstra_playerToNpc" method minus The heightpair and edge_penally cost code.
2/11/2024 11:54am -> Added a 2d array "moveCost" to hold the move costs for the trainers.
2/11/2024 12:23pm -> Changed populating nested for loop to populate heap based on npcType and moveCost.
2/11/2024 1:14pm -> Finished adding all cases for surrounding tiles in "dijkstra_playerToNpc".
2/11/2024 1:19pm -> Fixed gate value in "moveCost" which would give Aborted Core Dump error.
2/11/2024 1:30pm -> Added "printDistanceMap" method to print hiker and rival distance maps.
2/11/2024 1:37pm -> Added method calls to "dijkstra_playerToNpc" in main method when the spawn map is created, and after each each map is generated.
2/11/2024 2:00pm -> Fixed bug where if "5" was printed on the distance map it would mess up spacing, replaced it with "05".
2/11/2024 2:21pm -> Ran into bug where program would add to INT_MAX, resulting in negative values on distance map and ruin spacing.
2/12/2024 1:06pm -> Fixed bug by catching overflow or negative values and replacing them with spaces.
2/12/2024 1:31pm -> Ran into bug where my last bug fix would sometimes print out blank distance maps or just crash the program.
2/13/2024 2:04pm -> Fixed bug by creating new "infinity" called SHORT_MAX and used it instead of INT_MAX, unreachable spaces now print out as blank on the distance map.
