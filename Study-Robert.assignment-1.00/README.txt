For this project, I met the specification by printing out all 1728 potential knights tours using a recursive C program.
The createTour function is the recursive function that goes through each possible movement that the knight could make on the board.
The canMove function determines if the move will end up on the board, or if the space has already been used in the tour.
The printBoard function correctly displays the order of spaces in the given format from the assignment.
